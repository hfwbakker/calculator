# calculator

Goal: make a completely functional calculator as per Odin Project guidelines found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator

Current status:
At step 4, visuals have been created, event listeners have been added for all buttons (console.logs upon click), operate function has been written and works more or less.

Next up:
Make display reactive (e.g. click a number and it shows up in display). After that step 5 - 10.
